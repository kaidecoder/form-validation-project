### Validating Data

- The code defines functions to get HTML elements by their ID or class names.
- It retrieves references to various form elements, error messages, and icons using the functions mentioned above.
- There is a function validateField that checks if a field is empty and, if not, calls another function isValidField to perform specific validation based on the type of field (username, email, or password).
- The onSuccess and onError functions handle the display of success and error messages and icons.
- The event listener on form1 is set up to prevent the default form submission behavior and instead calls the validateField function for the username, email, and password fields when the form is submitted.
- mSimilar validation is performed for form2 (a login form) in the event listener attached to it.

PROBLEM: The login button is controlling the username and password fields of the signup button!!
